## How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

Every person on your team is an asset,and in our team agreement we did our best to make each one of us 
fit in his role and do what She/he likes to do, so the hard work will seem effortless.





## How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We sheduled a daily times to make meetings via zoom and discord, time will be from 10AM to 2PM daily
and it can be extended as the work requires. Also we made sure to make suitable break time fo us all 
. 

## In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
We all agreed that we want to make our best to develop in the AI field.
since ew are all new to this field we want to get the best to  do the libraries 

## Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

We scheduled a daily meeitng and night meetings for those who can attend 
then we used trello to write questions and find their answers together.


# Conflict Plan

1. What will be your group's process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

    *By Identifying the points of agreement and disagreement , and working on each conflict one by one*
    *Dividind the tasks into the team no one will be working more than the others*

2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
 - In such case we agreed to adress the problem on slack and verbaly on our meeitngs, and we will explain to him that each person in the team is an asset and can contribute, we should all work together to reach our project's goal 

3. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

4. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? 

The tasks will be divided on what we agree is the key strength for each person , and the problems will work on them together



- In our team work we did the following steps to make the plan go in a smooth way 
* We Emphasize on having a “speak up” culture
Many problems can be avoided if employees are encouraged to bring concerns forward early, preferably before potential violations occur. So We keep in touch in adressing each concern that occur 
* Listening up and following up
The most important way to encourage team membres to raise concerns is simply to take seriously those concerns that are raised. We will make sure that those who raise a complaint know you have dealt with it, and always follow up with them about the situation. When doing so, be sure to ask whether they have since experienced any retaliation.

5. How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
 - By followig our team agreements and work guides it is rare to have such case .
but if this happened then the best practice would be to reach out our Instructor or one of the TA\s
each member will adress it in his own words and we will find the best solution that serves our project goals and vision.



# Communication Plan

1. What hours will you be available to communicate?

- Everyday from 10:00AM - 2:00PM 

2. What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- discord and slack 

3. How often will you take breaks?


1. What is your plan if you start to fall behind? 

- increase the meetings time , and solve any problems in the project in the shortest possible time

-  we will identify the problems we are having ,and will try to get help as much as we can from the instructors to keep up with the project 

4. How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

- We will be communicating on slack, and we can arrange a meeting during the weekend if needed 

5. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voice is heard? 

- Dividing the tasks
- In the meetings time each one will talk about what he did and what problems he faced 

6. How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

- In the meetings each one will talk for a few minutes about what he did in the project, what problems he faced , and solve these problems together as a team 


# Work Plan
We believe in teamwork and that each person has unique strengths, so we'll divide the tasks amongst ourselves based on our own strengths. Also, in order to find the best idea, we will listen to recommendations from each one of us at any moment, research them, and consider them if they are better than the existing ones.

Teamwork includes a range of aspects, the most important of which is evenly splitting work and avoiding "lone wolf" attempts. To achieve that, we'll employ a variety of project management strategies. For example, we'll use a cross-functional flowchart (workflow diagram) to assist us understand which aspects of the project are dependent on each other, resulting in better deadlines and more efficient project management.

Microsoft Visio will be used to build the flowchart, and Trello will be used to organize the tasks (categorize tasks and monitor them). We have four categories in our Trello board:
To do: This category includes cards for upcoming tasks. Each card has a title, a brief, and the name of the team member who will be in charge of this assignment.

**Doing**: This category includes cards for tasks that are currently in progress. This category must always have a card for each team member during the project; otherwise, we will have unevenly distributed tasks.
Completed, this category includes cards for tasks on which we have completed work.
 Need help, this category includes cards for tasks on which a team member has become stuck. It essentially means requesting assistance from his/her colleagues.

## Git Process

**Components of the project that lives on GitHub:**

- Building the code
- Tracking the changes
- Innovate solutions to problems that might arise during the project

**Share the Project Repository:**

- Ask for the username of the team memeber that you're inviting as a collaborator.
- On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
- Under your repository name, click  Settings.
- In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  Collaborators & teams.
- Click Invite a collaborator.
- In the search field, start typing the name of the team member you want to invite, then click a name in the list of matches.
- Click Add NAME to REPOSITORY.
- The user will receive an email inviting them to the repository. Once they accept your invitation, they will have collaborator access to your repository.

**Accomplishing the features of the project will be done using Feature Branch Workflow:**

- The main branch stores the official release history, and the develop branch serves as an integration branch for features.
- Develop branch will contain the complete history of the project, whereas main will contain an abridged version.

**Command:**

    git branch develop
    git push -u origin develop

- Each new feature should reside in its own branch
- Feature branches use develop as their parent branch
- When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop. 
- Features should never interact directly with main.

**Creating a feature branch:**

    git checkout develop
    git checkout -b feature_branch

**Merge the feature_branch into develop:**

    git checkout develop
    git merge feature_branch

**During the project Pull Request review workflow will be used:**

*Reviewing*

- All team members should oversee others work by hosting a meeting that will be planned as a review for all the pull requests.

*Merging*
- The team leader will be responsible for the merging of the PRs the process will be done during the meeting.

- All the distributed tasks (Project Features) should be merged after checking the work with the team members during the meeting.
- All the distributed tasks (Project Features) will be merged at the end of each working day.
