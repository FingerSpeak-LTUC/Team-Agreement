## How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We sheduled a daily times to make meetings via zoom and discord, time will be from 10AM to 2PM daily
and it can be extended as the work requires. Also we made sure to make suitable break time fo us all 
. 


## How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
In our team work we did the following steps to make the plan go in a smooth way 
* We Emphasize on having a “speak up” culture
Many problems can be avoided if employees are encouraged to bring concerns forward early, preferably before potential violations occur. So We keep in touch in adressig each concern that occur 
* Listening up and following up
The most important way to encourage team membres to raise concerns is simply to take seriously those concerns that are raised. We will make sure that those who raise a complaint know you have dealt with it, and always follow up with them about the situation. When doing so, be sure to ask whether they have since experienced any retaliation.


## How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
By followig our team agreements and work guides it is rare to have such case .
but if this happened then the best practice would be to reach out our Instructor or one of the TA\s
each member will adress it in his own words and we will find the best solution that serves our project goals and vision.
