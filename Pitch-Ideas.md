# Ideas Pitch

## main idea 1: Future Alphabet (selected)

Teach kids how to write letters in the proper format using a virtual mouse (camera that detects the user's hand gestures using computer vision and artificial intelligence), we can use the following libraries:

    OpenCV: for image processing and drawing
    mediapipe: for hand tracking 
    autopy: for controlling the mouse movement and click 

### Pain points:
In our project, we want to solve the main problem that
the kids and toddlers face during their first years in the learning journey. which is writing Alphabetical letters. Most of them find it hard to write the letter in the proper form so they tend to draw what they see.
It is proven that writing in the air helps the kid to memorize the letter and the way to write it more efficiently.

### Stretch goals:

- The data is then gathered and analyzed to determine the most common errors made by each user so that the program can pay more attention to it and teach it to that child more intensively. Finally, offer each user data that can be visualized (e.x matplotlib).
- Voice recognition could be added for pronunciation of the - letters (e.x apiai, or google-cloud-speech).
- Provide words that start with each letter as an example.

## Main idea  2: Pac-Man

Make an AI bot that can learn how to play the game (Pac-Man) using computer vision and reinforcement learning (e.x OpenAI, gym, universe). This bot must reach a new record. To make it more challenging we suggest adding a time limit to the game.
For data analysis, we may compare the number of iterations required by the AI to win the game with the map size and enemy count. We can also see how long it takes the AI to get a new record.
